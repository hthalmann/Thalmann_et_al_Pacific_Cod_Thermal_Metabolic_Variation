The following R script file and data file contain all analyses and plots presented in Thalmann et al. Pacific Cod metabolism and swimming performance are similar across temperatures following prolonged thermal acclimation.>Script File: Thalmann_et_al_ThermalMetabolicVariation_Rscript.R>Data File: Thalmann_et_al_PacificCodThermalMetabolicVariation_Data.csv>Rows represent individual fish IDs, repeated for each unique oxygen consumption measurement from a swimming trial	>Columns:       >FishID: unique primary key identifier for an individual fish      >Temp_Trmt: Temperature treatment associated with each individual fish      >Expt: Unique experiment (1 or 2) associated with each individual fish      >TankID_Expt: Tank ID associated with each individual fish>SwimSpeed: Swimming speed (in body lengths per second) associated with each oxygen consumption reading during a swim trial.  Fish were generally run at each swimming speed for three iterations throughout a trial. >MO2: Oxygen consumption rate (in mg O2 per kg per h) associated with each measurement period in a trial.  MO2 values were calculated from raw respirometry data using Eqn. 1. >SMR: Standard metabolic rate (in mg O2 per kg per h), calculated as the y-intercept of the linear model log(MO2) = ?0 + ?1(swim speed) during the swim trial, representing theoretical oxygen uptake at zero speed.  SMR values were excluded from further analysis if the R2adj. from the model was < 0.4.>SMR_AdjRsq: R2adj. value from the linear model log(MO2) = ?0 + ?1(swim speed), used to exclude SMR values from models with poor fit. >RMR: Routine metabolic rate (in mg O2 per kg per h), calcuated as the 20% quantile for all MO2 measurements during the overnight period prior to the swim tunnel trial.>MMR: Maximum metabolic rate (in mg O2 per kg per h),calculated as the mean of the three highest MO2 measurements during the swim trial.  >Ucrit: Critical Swimming Speed (in mm per sec), representing the point in a swim trial at which a fish can no longer swim against the current, calculated from Eqn. 2>FAS: Factorial Aerobic Scope (in mg O2 per kg per h), calculated as the ratio of the difference between MMR and RMR for an individual (MMR/RMR)>AAS: Absolute Aerobic Scope (in mg O2 per kg per h), calculated as the net difference between MMR and RMR for an individual (MMR - RMR)      >SL_mm: Standard length of a fish in mm      >WholeFishWWT_g: Whole body wet weight of a fish in g      >Gonads: Presence or absence of gonads in an individual (yes/no)      >GonadsWWTg: Wet weight of gonads, if present, in g>ParasiteWWT: Wet weight of parasites, if present, in g.  Only available for Expt. 2>HSI: Hepatosomatic Index, calculated as [liver wet weight (g)] / [whole body wet weight (g)] * 100      >LiverLipids: mg of lipid per gram of liver tissue. Only available for Expt. 1.       >MuscleLipids: mg of lipid per gram of muscle tissue. Only available for Expt. 1.>Growth: Absolute growth rate (in mm per day), calculated as the difference in standard length at the time of the swim trial and standard length approximately 4 to 7 months prior (Expt. 1), or 3 to 6 months prior (Expt. 2), divided by the number of days elapsing between the two measurements. >MeanTemp_3Months: Temperature (in degrees C) of rearing tank, averaged over the final three months of the rearing period.>ActualTemp_DayofTrial: Temperature (in degrees C) of swim tunnel on day of trial>MeanSalinity_3Months: Salinity of rearing tank, averaged over the final three months of the rearing period.      >Salinity_DayofTrial: Salinity of swim tunnel on day of trial>DaylightHours: Number of hours of daylight for the rearing environment on the day the fish was acclimated to the swim tunnel. All fish were reared under a natural photoperiod for Kodiak Island, AK.>DaysSinceFeeding: Number of days between last feeding and the day of the swim trial (ranges between 2 to 5 days)>Acclimation: Number of days the fish was acclimated to rearing temperatures prior to swim trial
